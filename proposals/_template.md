# General Grant Proposal

* **Project:**: CHARGED PARTICLES

## Project Overview

### Overview
We’ve been quietly working behind the scenes for nearly a year on the next big thing in the NFT space.

Charged Particles was started in January 2020 as a protocol fusing Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

With the Charged Particle Protocol, you’re able to turn your favorite NFT into a yield-generating investment. Interest generated is fully programmable, creating endless opportunities for creativity.

### Project Details

The team has had offers to raise significant seed capital and go the route of “public launch, exchange listing, market making etc." However that approach would put the vast control of the tokens in the hands of speculators, rather than community members of Charged Particles.

For this reason, the team has committed to a full “fair launch” and is only contributing internally the bare minimum amount needed to properly bootstrap and allow the team to focus full time.  

In the past month, we've all shifted to full time effort.

Most of the code is still private until after we finish our audit and launch on mainnet. This is what is public: https://github.com/robsecord/ChargedParticlesEth

## Development Roadmap
Charged Particles is a long-term endeavor. This is our full-time focus and will be for a long time! Added the relevant mStable milestone here. Happy to add more if it'd make sense!

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to mStable.

For each milestone:

* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent))
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $50k.

### Milestone 1 - Implement mUSD as yield-asset on protocol
* **Estimated Duration:** 1.5 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** $15,000

We're incentivizing depositing assets (e.g. DAI) into NFTs with our Protocol. Once deposited, these assets are converted to yield-bearing assets (e.g. aDAI). Users are incentivized to Deposit and Hold these assets (e.g. aDAI) with our liquidity mining program, rewarding them in our native governance token. Would love to integrate mUSD SAVE.

### Community engagement

Supporting the mStable community and letting the world know about the integration is no problem at all. 

## Future Plans
The team's long-term plans and intentions are to make the protocol both interest-bearing asset & NFT agnostic. Nearly all NFTs will be able to be "charged" up, and that charge will be available in nearly all the interest-bearing assets out there (e.g. cDAI, aDAI, yDAI, mUSD, etc.)

## Additional Information
We've turned down investment capital and have opted to bootstrap and launch. We've recently applied to Aave's grant round as well.
